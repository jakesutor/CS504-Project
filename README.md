# CS504 Final Project
We will use NBA Stats from Kaggle.com to determine what are the key predictors of future All-Stars.

#### Background and Rationale
During free agency, teams need to determine who the best players would be to pick up and fill their needed roles. This is often a difficult task as there are several factors that go into picking up a new player. In order to simplify the process, teams might benefit from having a framework for determining the best players in free agency.

#### Research
The research required for this problem will include identifying past All-Stars as well as the key statistics and performance indicators that are associated with those players' success. Identifying these will allow us to build a predictive model of future All-Stars for teams to pick up in free agency.

#### Project Objectives
Our objective is to create a model to most accurately predict All-Star players, and identify the key predictors for becoming an All-Star. Through these objectives, teams will more easily identify players they want to pick up through free agency.

#### Problem Space
For this project, we will seek to answer the question: ‘Which players should NBA teams seek to acquire based on their likelihood of becoming All-Stars?’ We will seek to achieve our objective to develop a model that predicts future All-Stars by investigating players’ season averages, including variables such as their points scored, efficiency, and +/-, in each season since 2007. 

#### Primary User Story (-ies):
Based on the context described above, we have developed the following primary user story to guide our project:
“As a member of an NBA team’s front office personnel, I want to be able to plug player statistics into a model and determine what player to pursue in free agency.”

#### Solution Space
Our model delivers value to its users when it accurately predicts which players will be most successful in future NBA seasons. We expect our model will enable NBA teams to be better equipped to target the best available players in free agency. 

#### Product Vision
For: NBA Front Office Personnel 
Who:  Seek to identify future NBA All-Star players available in free agency 
The: All-Star Model 
Is a: Statistical modeling software 
That: Assists personnel in identifying the top players available in free agency 
Unlike: Basing free agency acquisition off of points scored and other game statistics 
Our product: Utilizes advanced analytics techniques to identify key performance indicators of success 
Caveats: The primary differentiation of our product and traditional scouting is that our product uses a standardized and objective process of identifying high-performing players
